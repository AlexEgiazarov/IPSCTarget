# IPSCTarget
A small project designed for training in home environment. IPSC target used as a standard.
Yes, I'm lazy with global variables, "we'll fix it in post".

## Equipment
User is required to have a red laser emmiting equipment to produce "shots".
Cold temp light, as the algorithm detects red color.

## How to use
Start the 
''target.py''
script and mark the corners of the target.
Script will detect if the shots are placed inside or outside the target

## Planned work
Previous version of the module was lost, so some features are not available.
TODO:
Shot placement on the virtual target.
Shot timer functionality
Calibration menu
